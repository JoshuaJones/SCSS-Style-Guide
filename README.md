## <a name="css-style-guide">CSS Style Guide</a>

While the focus of this style guide is primarily Sass/SCSS, it's important to touch on a few basic CSS formatting rules that should carry over.

#### Indentation & Whitespace

Be consistent with indentation and whitespace. Soft tabs with a tab size of 2 is popular.

```css
/* Bad */
.class {
    background: #000;
  font-size: 13px;
  }

/* Good */
.class {
  background: #000;
  font-size: 13px;
}
```

#### Keep Properties Organized

Make sure your selector's properties follow some form of organization.

```css
/* Bad */
.class {
  font-size: 14px;
  display: block;
  color: #333;
  background: #fff;
}

/* Good - Alphabetical */
.class {
  background: #fff;
  color: #333;
  display: block;
  font-size: 14px;
}

/* Good - Grouped Properties */
.class {
  /* Box Model */
  display: block;

  /* Type */
  color: #333;
  font-size: 14px;
  
  /* Other */
  background: #fff;
}
```

#### Selector Naming Scheme

Keep selector names clear and following a structure. For example, if there is inner markup related to the parent, keep a naming scheme.

```css
.modal {}
.modal-header {}
.modal-content {}
.modal-footer {}
```

#### IDs

Don't use them for styling elements. Argument could be made to use them for a project's basic structure and JS hooks, but the specificity is too high to merit using them for styling.

## <a name="file-structure">File Structure</a>

How you organize your files can speed up development and make it more clear about what file applies where. Below is a basic structure for a small site.

```
css/
 |- main.css (compiled stylesheet)
 |- scss/
      |- main.scss
      |- global.scss
      |- _variables.scss
      |- modal.scss
      |- sections/
           |- contact.scss
           |- about.scss
```

Files can be broken down as much as the project needs. For example, if the project contained more shared global rules, a `global` directory could be created and `global.scss`, `variables.scss` and 'modal.scss' could be moved into there for even cleaning organization.

#### main.scss

The `main.scss` *(global.scss, style.scss, etc.)* should not have any selector rules present. It should act only as a *"Table of Contents"* using this structure:

1. Vendor Globals
2. Project Globals
3. Reusable Patterns (modals, tabs, etc)
4. Section Specific
5. [shame.css](http://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/)

```scss
//Vendor
@import "compass";

// Globals
@import "variables";
@import "global";

// Reusable Patterns
@import "modal.scss";

// Sections
@import "sections/about";
@import "sections/contact";

// Shame
@import "shame";
```

## <a name="selector-nesting">Selector Nesting</a>

The ability to nest selectors is great for visual organization of code, but can be abused if developers aren't thinking about the output they are creating. **The maximum nesting level should only be three levels deep**

You wouldn't write the following selector in pure css: `.block .block-header .block-inner h2 span {}`, so don't do it with Sass/SCSS!

```scss
// Bad - output will be overly specific selectors
.block {
  .block-header {
    .block-inner {
      h2 { 
        span {}
      }
      h3 {}
      p {}
    }
  }
}

// Good
.block {
  .block-header {
    h2 {}
  }
}
```

## <a name="properties-organization">Properties/Rules Organization</a>

Ordering properties/rules in Sass/SCSS can help keep things clear and easier to read.

1. @extend
2. Regular Rules
3. @includes
4. Nested Selectors

```scss
// Bad
.class {
  background: #fff;
  @extend %module;
  @include transition(background 0.2s ease);
  h3 { font-size: 24px; }
  color: #333;
  @include float(left);
}

// Good
.class {
  @extend %module;
  background: #fff;
  color: #333;
  @include float(left);
  @include transition(background 0.2s ease);

  h3 { font-size: 24px; }
}
```

Separating rules and nested selectors like so makes the code more clear and easier read.
